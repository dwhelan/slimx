This [[table table][http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SliM.TableTable]] allows you to specify package names to search for variable classes if they are not fully qualified.
This allows your acceptance tests to be more readable.

This table will search files and jars specified in the class path for public concrete classes. It will output a row for each class imported so you can see exactly what was imported.

The first cell in each row of the table specifies a package name to import for searching for system variable classes.
The second cell in each row is optional and specifies a specific class in the package to import.
!3 Load all classes from a package
This table will import all classes in the ''jfitnesse.slim'' package.

!|table:import classes|
|fitnesse.slim|
!3 Load some classes from a package
If you want to specify multiple classes in the package you can leave the first cell blank and the previous package name will be used.

!|table:import classes|
|fitnesse.slim|ConverterSupport|
||ConverterTest|

You cannot import all classes in package that are loaded with the Java VM. You must explicitly specify the classes to load.

For example:

Instead of this:

|comment|
|table:import classes|
|java.lang|

Do this:

|table:import classes|
|java.lang|String|

!3 Unloading classes
You can unload a specific class using a ''-'' prefix before the class name:

!|table:import classes|
|fitnesse.slim|-ConverterSupport|

You can unload all classes in package by using a ''-'' prefix package name:

!|table:import classes|
|-fitnesse.slim|

!3 Showing all imported classes
If you do not specify any classes to be imported then the table will show you all imported classes.
!|table:import classes|

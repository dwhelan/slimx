This [[table table][http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SliM.TableTable]] allows you to show variables.

When run this table will show properties of the variable. This is useful for exploratory testing and debugging your acceptance tests.

!3 Show properties of a variable
If the table has a second row then only those properties will be shown.

|table:show variable|$foo|
|field 1|field 2|
!3 Show all properties of a variable
If the table does not have a second row then all properties will be shown.

|table:show variable|$foo|
!3 Show all elements of a list variable
If the variable is a list you can display all the elements of by adding a cell with 'elements' in it.

|table:show variable|$fooBar|elements|

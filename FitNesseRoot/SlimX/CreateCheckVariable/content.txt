This [[script][http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SliM.ScriptTable]] table allows you to generate the contents for a [[Check Variable][CheckVariable] table for a variable.

You would you this is if you were using a [[Show Variable][Show Variable]] table and wanted to convert the table into a [[Check Variable][CheckVariable] so that the results would be verified.
You may find this useful if you want to automate an exploratory test or if you want to generate characterization tests.

The cell that follow '''create check object''' specifies the variable that you want to check.

When executed a cell will be generated that contains the generated wiki text for checking the variable with instructions on how to use it.

|table:show variable|$foo|
|field 1|field 2|

Hmmm that looks right, now I would like to create a regression test for that.

If I want to check all the properties I would change the word ''show'' in the above table to ''create check'' like this:

|table:create check variable|$foo|
|field 1|field 2|

|table:create check variable|$fooBar|elements|
|field 1|field 2|

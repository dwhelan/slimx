This [[script][http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SliM.ScriptTable]] table allows you to generate the contents for a [[Check Variable][CheckVariable]] table for a variable.

You would you this is if you were using a [[Show Variable][Show Variable]] table and wanted to convert the table into a [[Check Variable][CheckVariable=] so that the results would form a regression test.
You may find this useful if you want to automate an exploratory test or if you want to generate characterization tests.

The cell that follow '''create check variable''' specifies the variable that you want to check.

When executed a cell will be generated that contains the generated wiki text for checking the variable with instructions on how to use it.
!3 Using this table
Let's say I doing some exploratory testing and I am examining a variable like this:

|table:show variable|$foo|
|field 1|field 2|

I run this and all everything looks right. Now I would like to create a regression test for that. I would change the word ''show'' in the above table to ''create check'' like this:

#|comment|
|table:create check variable|$foo|
|field 1|field 2|

When run, an additional row will be created with the wiki text that you can use as regression test. It will look something like:
{{{|query: check variable|$variable|
|field 1|field 2|
|foo|0.0|}}} I can replace the original ''show variable'' table with this one being sure to replace ''$variable'' with the variable name that I wish to test:
{{{|query: check variable|$foo|
|field 1|field 2|
|foo|0.0|}}} The net result will be a table like this:

|query: check variable|$foo|
|field 1|field 2|
|foo|0.0|
!3 Creating check tables for lists
Simply add a cell with ''elements'' after the variable cell and the generated wiki code will check all elements of the list:

|table:create check variable|$fooBar|elements|

!-SlimX provides simple fixtures that all you to run FitNesse acceptance tests without having to write fixtures.
SlimX extends FitNesse/Slim variables to be of any type - not just Strings. The SlimX fixtures use these variables to allow direct access to the system under test. -!

[[SlimX acceptance tests][SlimX]]
!3 Classes
The following fixtures allow you to access and inspect classes:

|[[Import Classes][SlimX.ImportClasses]]|Allows you to specify variable classes without a package name in your tables. You can also remove imported classes and show all imported classes.|
|[[Show Class][SlimX.ShowClass]]|Shows properties, constructors and methods of a class. Useful when authoring acceptance tests so you can see what properties, functions and constructors are available.|
!3 Variables
The following fixtures allow you to create, access, show and check variables:

|[[Create Variable][SlimX.CreateVariable]]|Creates variables of arbitrary classes.|
|[[Access Variable][SlimX.AccessVariable]]|Provides access to variables for calling functions and checking.|
|[[Show Variable][SlimX.ShowVariable]]|Shows properties of variables. Useful for exploratory testing or simply showing information that supports an acceptance test.|
|[[Check Variable][SlimX.CheckVariable]]|Check the properties of a variable.|
|[[Create Check Variable][SlimX.CreateCheckVariable]]|Creates the wiki text for a [[Check Variable][SlimX.CheckVariable]] of a variable from a [[Show Variable][SlimX.ShowVariable]] table. Used to convert exploratory tests into regression tests.|
!3 Properties
Properties are obtained from the variables following the normal Java ''getter'' convention.
For example, every variable has a ''class'' property because every Java object has a ''getClass()'' method.
!3 Functions
The [[Create Variable][SlimX.CreateVariable]] and [[Access Variable][SlimX.ShowVariable]] script tables set the System Under Test object to the specified variable so that you can invoke any public method on a variable.
